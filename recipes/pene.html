    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I threw this dish of penne pasta, pancetta bacon, and mushrooms together one afternoon for lunch. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until browned but not crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
      <li>Pour pancetta grease out of the skillet, and add butter. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in sliced mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and released their liquid. Add the minced garlic, and cook 2 more minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, then stir in cream and Italian seasoning. Simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
      <li>To serve, toss the cooked penne with the sauce, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
